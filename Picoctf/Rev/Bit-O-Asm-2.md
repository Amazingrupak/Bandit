# Bit-O-Asm-2
The problem statement:
```
Can you figure out what is in the eax register? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}. Download the assembly dump here.
```
Downloading the dump, here is what we get.
```
<+0>:     endbr64 
<+4>:     push   rbp
<+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
<+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
<+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
<+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x9fe1a
<+22>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
<+25>:    pop    rbp
<+26>:    ret

```
DWORD PTR is a ptr that last gets the value 0x9fe1a. That in decimal is 654874 and the flag is picoCTF{654874}
